```
npm install -g <package>
```

> The -g flag tells npm to install the package globally. Local packages are used in your application.For instance, React as a library will be a local package which can be required in your application for usage.

```
npm install <package> .
```

> One more word about the package.json. The file enables you to share your project with other developers without sharing all the node packages. The file has all the references of node packages used in your project. These packages are called dependencies. Everyone can copy your project without the dependencies. The dependencies are references in the package.json. Someone who copies your project can simply install all packages by using npm install on the command line. The npm install script takes all the dependencies listed in the package.json file and installs them in the node_modules/ folder.

```
npm install --save-dev <package>
```

> The --save-dev flag indicates that the node package is only used in the development environment. It will not be used in production when you deploy your application on a server.
