npm install -g <package>
    The -g flag tells npm to install the package globally. Local packages are used in your application.
    For instance, React as a library will be a local package which can be required in your application for
    usage. 

You can install it via the terminal by typing:
npm install <package>
npm install react

The installed package will automatically appear in a folder called node_modules/ and will be listed
in the package.json file next to your other dependencies.

To initialize the node_modules/ folder and the package.json file for your project.There is a npm command to initialize a npm project and thus a package.json file. Only when
you have that file, you can install new local packages via npm.
